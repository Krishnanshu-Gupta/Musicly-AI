# Musicly AI üéµ

Musicly AI is an intelligent music system designed to classify songs into genres, extract lyrics using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), and generate genre-specific lyrics. Additionally, the system can extend songs with instrumental enhancements, creating a seamless listening experience. This project leverages machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, integrated with a Flask web application for a user-friendly interface.

## Features ‚ú®
- **Song Genre Classification**: Identifies the genre of a song using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
- **Lyric Extraction**: Automatically extracts lyrics from songs using ASR techniques.
- **Lyric Generation**: Generates genre-specific lyrics based on the song's lyrical and contextual patterns.
- **Song Extension**: Adds instrumental enhancements to extend the song duration.
- **Web Interface**: Simple and interactive Flask web app for song uploads and outputs.

## Data

Data can be retrieved from the [GTZAN Genre Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification), which provides audio files categorized into 10 genres:

- **Genres**: Blues, Classical, Country, Disco, Hip Hop, Jazz, Metal, Pop, Reggae, Rock
- **Files per Genre**: 100 audio files
- **Duration**: Each file is 30 seconds long
- **Sampling Rate**: 22050 Hz

### Preprocessing
The dataset is processed by:
- Splitting audio files into smaller segments for training (3-second clips).
- Creating Audio Waveform, Spectogram, and Mel-Spectogram visualizations.
- Extracting MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) features for each segment as input for the model.
